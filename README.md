# Problem Statement

In our busy lives, it's hard to keep track of everything we need to do. Current methods, such as handwritten notes or generic to-do apps, lack the features needed for  daily task management. I've developed a user-friendly task management website inspired by Trello, designed specifically for individuals. It allows easy organization of tasks with customizable boards.

## Target Users

This site is built for all se足eking a simple and spee足dy way to monitor routine responsibilities. If you're足 aiming to stay orderly and get things done, this application is made足 just for you!

## Demo

## Project summary

In building this task management website, creating smooth drag-and-drop task functionality with React Beautiful DND was a bit tricky. Another exciting challenge was integrating Google OAuth for secure user logins, involving navigation through Google Cloud Console and implementing Google Login securely.
